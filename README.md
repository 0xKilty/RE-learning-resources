> Resources to learn more about reverse engineering and binary exploitation

## Tools
- [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) - A tool developed by the NSA for reverse engineering which is widely used

## Heap Exploitation
- [how2heap](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap) - a repo for learning various heap exploitation techniques

- [heap-exploitation](https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/) - a book about the internals of glibc malloc and free and exploitation techniques

- [Cueing up a calculator: an introduction to exploit development on Linux](https://github.blog/2023-12-06-cueing-up-a-calculator-an-introduction-to-exploit-development-on-linux/) - an article explaining heap exploitation used in [CVE-2023-43641](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43641) and how the vulnerability was discovered along with the development of an exploit

### Motive
I'm trying to learn more about reverse engineering and binary explotation but it's such an information packed subject that the resources can be overwhelming. 

This repo tackles that problem by gathering all the resources in one spot and give a brief description.
